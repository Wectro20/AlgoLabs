# TASK

Implement a sorting algorithm. 
The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma.

## The result should display:

- The name of the algorithm
- Work time
- The number of comparison operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm
- The number of exchange operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm
- Sorting results

## The code must be covered by tests that verify:

- sort the input array
- sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order
- sort descending sorted array descending

## To Run

To sort by desc
```
$ java HeapSort.java desc 1,2,56,45,-9,78,11,1,24,43434,535,55,35,5,3,8,7,5,3,2,-3,-4 hs
```
To sort by asc
```
$ java HeapSort.java asc 1,2,56,45,-9,78,11,1,24,43434,535,55,35,5,3,8,7,5,3,2,-3,-4 hs
```
