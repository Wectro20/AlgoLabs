## Task: 
- Knuth–Morris–Pratt Algorithm for Pattern Searching
- Matching pattern in sub-strings at input string

## How it Works:
- The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property</br>
 (pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) </br>
 of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to O(n). </br>
 The basic idea behind KMP’s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch</br>
 (after some matches), we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. 
 
 ## How to Start
 - simply run KMP
